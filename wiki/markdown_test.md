## This page is a markdown example

This page tests the rendering and displaying of Markdown content. It is called `markdown_test.md` and it's okay to delete it. It is also a pretty good example of how to structure content using markdown syntax, so you can also use it as a learning tool. 

### This headline separates things

#### And this one separates more things, but is a bit smaller

To illustrate lists and how they work, here is the discography for [Boards of Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada). It also shows usage for bold and italics:

* *1995:* **"Twoism"** - (Music70)
* *1996:* **"Hi Scores"** - (Skam)
* *1998:* **"Aquarius"** - (Skam)
* *1998:* **Music Has the Right to Children** – (Warp/Skam)
* *1999:* **Peel Session TX 21/07/1998** (Warp)
* *2000:* **In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country** – (Warp/Music70)
* *2002:* **Geogaddi** – (Warp/Music70)
* *2005:* **The Campfire Headphase** – (Warp)
* *2006:* **Trans Canada Highway** (Warp)

## How to include code snippets

Here's how you build a useless 20000 item array of, well, numbers up to 20000.

    var a = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < 20000; i++){
      a.push(0):
    }

And this is how you include inline snippets of code: `require 'commonplace'`

## Last, but most certainly not least

This is how you include amazing imagery from the wonderful world of the internet. Here's our sad Commonplace mechanical turk operator, also shown when you visit a page [that doesn't exist](/apagethatdoesntexistunlessyouareawesome).

## Final words

I hope this example file finds you well, and that you reach its very end happy and amused. If not, at least you're patient, because reading the kind of crap I write is, well, a spectacular waste of time. Maybe you'd like to [follow me on the worlds of twitter](http://twitter.com/f) to read more?
